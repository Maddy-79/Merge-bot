# utils/db.py - NOT NEEDED as a separate module for now.
# We are storing data in JSON files under bot/database/ as users.json and tasks.json
# But if you want a wrapper to read/write JSON, here's a simple one:

import json
from pathlib import Path

def read_json(file_path):
    file = Path(file_path)
    if not file.exists():
        return {}
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        return json.load(f)

def write_json(file_path, data):
    with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

# Example Usage:
# users = read_json('bot/database/users.json')
# users['some_user_id'] = {...}
# write_json('bot/database/users.json', users)
